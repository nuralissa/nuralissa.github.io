    <h2>Welcome to this segment! It's the Novel!</h2>
    <p>In this page, i will talk about my favorite books that i've read. I really likes to read, especially fictional genre books. Why? Well, it won't hurt for a girl to dream, right? So, that's it!</p>
    <br><hr>
    <p>The first book is Internet Death Angel by Harleen. This author, she is the one from the orange app, which i think most of the bookworms all over the world would know about her. I also knew about her books from there before she published it as physical book.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

    </div>
    <p>This book have its sequel which name Hazrael. The first book is about how the main characters meet before they had their journey together. And in this second book, the emotional turmoil and those people they once trust, betrayed them making the story satisfying as it have slight action, drama and other cool stuffs that you can imagine while read this novel.
    <br><hr><br>
    <p>Next novel is Behind the Hoodie by Harleen. This is the second recommendation that is from the same author. Yes, it's by Harleen again. I cannot argue as her works always good, like the story she created, it was as if it is real.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="abe_hoodie.jfif" alt="Behind the Hoodie by Harleen" width="400" height="200">
    </div>
    <p>Again, this book is a sequel from the first book, which i don't remember since it is been a long time since I had read them.</p>
    <p>This book is a total madness. I am not sure how the female lead can be in sane state while her husband is being such a thrash. I mean... This book also included a bit of black magic mention as the husband, which is the male lead is being curse to hate his own wife by another woman that they are close with. Things happened when the jealousy started to fill their life. The emotional turmoil in this book, for me,... fuh! I am going crazy. Yes, that is what i thought while reading them.</p>
    <p>Overall, this book is fine. Like, it is good if you like to feel the hate, sad, and hurt feelings all in one.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Both of this book can be purchase at our local bookstore such as Syarikat Adam and Popular bookstores.</p>
