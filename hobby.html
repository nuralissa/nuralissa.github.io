    <h2>This is My Hobbies!</h2>
    <p>For this page, I will talk about my hobbies. There is one thing about me, i do have many hobbies but when I finally find them boring, I would change into new ones. So, most of the time, I will change them whenever I find another things that could entertain my curious nature.</p>

    <p>Firstly, badminton. Yeah. The one of the only sport that I can play until my heart content because of my condition. These past few years, a lot of things happened and it damaging my body. So, badminton is the only sport I can play when I want to since my mom also would not allowed me to do anything that could inflict harm on my body.</p>

    <p>The next one is playing mobile games. I preferred and mostly play online games. I have a page that tell about the mobile games I played. Before, I played various of mobile games especially the one like PUBG, Free Fire and Mobile Legend. But now, the only games that I played are Good Coffee, Great Coffee, Path to Nowhere and Honkai Star Rail.
    <p>Lastly, reading. I really love read fictional books. This is because I can imagine the things that I read with my own imagination. The author would sometimes provided pictures to guide the reader on the characteristic of their characters which is for me isn't really good because I like to use my imagination.
